A selection of my favourite quotes I’ve come across recently…

-

   -  **L1 cache** - 3s grabbing a piece of paper
   -  **L2 cache** - 14s picking a book from a shelf
   -  **System RAM** - 4m walk down the hall
   -  **Hard drive seek** - Like leaving the building to roam the
      earth for one year and three months

Gustavo Duarte (via Brandon Rhodes at pycon us - `Python Linkers and
Virtual Memory`_)

-  “The purpose of software engineering is to control complexity, not to
   create it.”

Pamela Zave (via Jon Bentley’s - `Programming Pearls`_)

-  “I think it’s better to give users the rope they want than to try and
   prevent them from hanging themselves, since otherwise they’ll just
   use the power cords as ropes and electrocute themselves.”

Guido van Rossum - `resolving a TZ-aware local time request`_

-  “I think that if I was running a company like Microsoft I would ask
   everyone to read Code Complete, but if I were running a start up, I
   would ask no-one to read Code Complete. Code Complete is all about
   being exceptionally conservative with your programming practise. If
   you have a small company full of brilliant programmers you don’t
   really want to tie their hands, you want to let them go as far as
   they can with the language they’ve got. If you have tens of thousands
   of programmers, you would like everyone to not do anything
   interesting at all, to use the most basic of design patterns, to
   never optimize their code because it get’s harder for the person
   whose behind them or they might make a mistake during optimisation.”

Raymond Hettinger (via `Radio Free Python`_)

-  “Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent
   perspiration.”

Thomas Edison (via Linus Torvalds `Aalto talk`_)

-  “Yes, I really like Python, I like it for a very specific reason, I
   like Python because of all the languages I have ever used it is the
   one that maximises ease of long term maintainability. That is the
   ease with which you can read your code six months later, and the
   longer I program the more convinced I am that that is **the** most
   important metric of a language…..\ **bar none**.”

Eric ‘ESR’ Raymond `presenting to the Philadelphia Area Java Users’
Group`_

-  “The cheapest, fastest and most reliable components of a computer
   system are those that aren’t there.”

Gordon Bell (via Jon Bentley’s - `Programming Pearls`_)
